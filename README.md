made a resume screening application using flask ü§ñ Smart Resume Screening System Overview In today's fast-moving job market, recruiters are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resumes received for a single job opening. Manually screening these documents is a tedious and time-consuming process. This project, the Smart Resume Screening System, offers an intelligent solution to this challenge by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the entire screening process.

This web-based application allows recruiters to upload a job description along with multiple resumes. The system then intelligently parses, analyzes, and ranks each resume based on its relevance to the job description, significantly reducing hiring time and effort.

‚ú® Features Web-Based Interface: A user-friendly interface built with Flask for easy interaction. Bulk Resume Upload: Upload one job description and multiple resumes simultaneously. Automated Parsing: Extracts key information from resumes, including candidate name, email, and the full text content. AI-Powered Scoring: Utilizes an advanced language model to calculate a relevance score for each resume against the job description. Ranked Results: Displays all submitted resumes in a clean, sortable table, ranked from the most to least suitable. Database Integration: All results and candidate data are securely stored in a MySQL database. Automated Email Notifications: Automatically sends emails to the top 5 highest-scoring candidates to notify them of their successful screening. Data Visualization: Generates insightful pie charts to help recruiters understand trends and analytics from the uploaded resumes. üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Backend: Python, Flask Database: MySQL NLP/Resume Parsing: pyresparser, spaCy, or similar libraries Machine Learning: scikit-learn (for TF-IDF/Cosine Similarity) or Transformer models Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript üöÄ How It Works Upload: The recruiter uploads a single job description file and multiple resume files (.pdf) through the web portal. Parsing: The system uses a resume parsing library to read each resume and extract essential details like the applicant's name, email address, and the complete text. Scoring: An NLP model processes the text from both the job description and each resume. It then calculates a cosine similarity or other relevance score to determine how well the resume matches the job requirements. Ranking & Storage: The candidates are ranked based on their scores. All extracted data, including the scores, is stored in the MySQL database. Display: The ranked list of candidates is presented on the dashboard in a clear and organized table. Notification: The system automatically identifies the top 5 candidates and sends them a notification email. Analytics: Visual dashboards display statistics derived from the pool of resumes.
